## Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Node.js: This will install both Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). You can check the installations by running node -v and npm -v in your terminal.

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Before you can run the project, you need to install the necessary dependencies. In the project directory, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:
   Now you're ready to start the development server and run the project locally:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The project will now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port mentioned in the terminal). Open your web browser and navigate to this address to see the project running.

4. **(Optional) Build the Project**:
   If you want to build the project for production, run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will create a `build` directory with the compiled and minified project files, ready for deployment.
